Data Engineering with GCP and Terraform in the DC Universe
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to deploy a data engineering pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Inspired by superheroes, the project simulates how superheroes store equipment in BigQuery datasets and process data from GCS buckets representing villains.

The project includes:

    Managing BigQuery datasets and GCS buckets.
    Processing and transforming unstructured data with Dataflow.
    Orchestrating the pipeline using Cloud Composer.
    Defining IAM roles and service accounts for access control.

Technologies Used

    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services: BigQuery, GCS, Dataflow, Cloud Composer, IAM
    Terraform: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Conclusion

This project shows how to use Terraform to automate the deployment of a data pipeline on Google Cloud. It highlights key GCP services such as BigQuery, GCS, and Dataflow, while demonstrating how to manage access using IAM roles.
